# Car-AI
This is an AI programming project during my second year at Stafforshire University. 
I was initially given a simple framework, to this I have added AI steering behaviours and pathfinding. 

Controls

A- Arrive behaviour -> Blue car slows down the closer it gets to its destination.

S- Seek behaviour -> Blue car seeks to random waypoint on map.p

P- Pathfinding -> Red car uses A* pathfinding to go the next waypoint, by continually pressing p the car will eventually navigate to the nearest passenger.

F- Flee behaviour -> Blue car flees from red car.

W- Wander behaviour -> Red car continually moves to random waypoint on map.

Space - Blue car stops.

Left click -Red car moves to point you clicked.
